## What is Izuna?

Izuna is a **Discord Bot** that mainly built as my hobby project in exploring web technologies. Every functionalities that I'm building follows the same pattern: to make something that I want to use as well. Therefore, as lots of my leisure activities revolves around getting entertainment in ACG (Anime, Comic, Games), expect features in strong relation to those things.

        Izuna is a character from mobile game "Blue Archive".
        <br />
        Her full name is Kuda Izuna (久田イズナ) and is a first-year high school student in Allied Hyakkiyako Academy in Kivotos. <br />
        <br />
        My main reason of using her name is purely because I love her character and I wish I have an energetic fox-girl tailing me while happily refering me as
        "My Lord" or (主殿！).
        <br />
        <br />
        It's really... just for personal satisfaction. But hey, it boosts my motivation to keep on programming, so that's never a bad thing, ay?

## Features

This section contains the list of features currently implemented in Izuna

<HelpCommand components={props.components} />

### `music`

Implements music bot functionality. Currently only in text message mode. Supports Youtube and external link (as long as it's publicly accessible **without authentication**).

The bot implements playlist where tracks in playlist is preserved after it finished playing.
Subcommands :

-   play  
    Play a music. Accepts Youtube link and regular HTTP URL.  
    Examples

    > `izuna play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`

    This will play the link given.

    > `izuna play suzuki konomi there is a reason`

    This will search Youtube for all the query after the `play` command and play the top result.

-   pause  
    Pauses the current playlist. Use the same command or alias `resume` to play again.  
    Examples

    > `izuna pause`

    This pauses the currently playing track. Calling `izuna pause` or

    > `izuna resume`

    will resume the player.

-   stop  
    Stops the entire playlist. This will wipe the entire playlist and exits the voice channel.
    > `izuna stop`
-   seek  
    Seek to desired position of the current playing track. Accepts number (in seconds) or string with the `h` for hours, `m` for minutes, and `s` for seconds.  
    Example :

    > `izuna seek 240`

    This will set the current playhead to second 240 of the track, or 4 minutes into the track.

    > `izuna seek 3h25m1s`

    This will set the current playhead to 3:25:01 position into the track. Useful for long videos.

-   skip  
    Skip currently playing track. If `jump` is previously called, will play the next track as specified in most recent `jump` position.
    > `izuna skip`
-   jump  
    Set the next playhead position. If called when playlist ended, will instantly play the track in target position.

    > `izuna jump 13`

    This will set the next track to track 13 (1-based indexing).

The bot will not leave the channel if there is nothing plays or no one in the voice channel as it's intentionally not implemented. I believe in playlist that shouldn't be ephemeral.
